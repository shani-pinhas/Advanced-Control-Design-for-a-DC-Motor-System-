# Advanced-Control-Design-for-a-DC-Motor-System-
This project models and controls a DC motor driven electromechanical system. It develops dynamic equations, analyzes system response, and designs controllers to enhance stability and performance. Both classical and modern control approaches—frequency-domain, state-space, LQR, and observer design are implemented to ensure  robust operation.
